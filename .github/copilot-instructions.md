# MacIntodd Math Site - Copilot Instructions

This is a Next.js website for an Algebra 2 class featuring assignments, interactive math apps, and student progress tracking.

## Project Structure
- Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Uses App Router structure with src directory
- Designed for educational content delivery and interactive learning

## Key Features
1. **Assignment Pages**: Organized by units (Unit 1-4) with practice problems
2. **Interactive Math Apps**: React components for practicing specific skills
3. **Progress Tracking**: Will integrate with Google Sheets API for student data
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly educational interface

## Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow educational best practices for math content presentation
- Create interactive components that help students learn
- Design for accessibility and clear visual hierarchy
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for consistent styling

## Math Content Focus
- Linear Functions (Unit 1)
- Systems of Equations (Unit 2) 
- Quadratic Functions (Unit 3)
- Exponential Functions (Unit 4)
- Each unit should have assignments and corresponding practice apps

## Future Integrations
