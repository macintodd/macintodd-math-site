# MacIntodd Math AI handoff

The M4 Mac mini is the primary editing machine. The AI on the other Mac reviews changes on GitHub. Use GitHub `main` as the published source and follow [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for maintenance rules. Review the latest commits before starting work.

## Latest application change

- Slide 1 now confirms a correct sketch in two small graph callouts. Three arrows identify the red solution line, the gold point, and the blue given line. The student continues to equation entry from below the graph.
- P3 on Slide 3 supports an optional tap or drag sketch and **Check line**. The exact y-intercept is −14/3. The directions prompt students to derive the equation in point-slope form and submit it in slope-intercept form.
- The header arrows step through reached problems and retain the current lesson's sketches and typed work. The first unsolved equation limits forward navigation.
- `ced4605` removed the slope input and keypad beside the sketch. A tap draws through the given gold point and replaces the previous red point. A drag starts where the student presses.
- Routes are the [student beta lesson](https://www.macintodd.net/apps/beta/parallel-perpendicular-lesson) and [teacher presentation](https://www.macintodd.net/apps/beta/parallel-perpendicular-lesson/teacher).

## MathBoard mirroring

- `c56cf8f` added the native bridge. The controller sends snapshots through `window.MathBoardApplet.publishState(snapshot)`. The external display receives them through `window.mathBoardAppletSetState(snapshot)`, registers once, and renders read-only without sending received state back. Regular browsers work without the native bridge.
- In `ced4605`, the graph snapshot carries the tapped point as part of the sketch segment so the external display draws the same line and single red marker. Drag endpoints, selected coordinate labels, diagnostic zoom, equation animation, language, dialogs, and the local completion image still mirror. The removed sketch slope editor no longer contributes state.
- The existing graphical-success flag now renders the Slide 1 callouts on the read-only display. The existing progress and graph snapshots carry the reviewed problem index and the P3 sketch. The bridge methods and snapshot version stay the same.

## Verification and deployment

- Passed `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run check:content`, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check` for the callout, P3 sketch, and navigation update.
- Passed the parallel lesson regression scripts (`scripts/test-parallel-*.mjs`), the beta Spanish regression, and the MathBoard regression. In simulated iPad landscape and phone viewports, checked the bubble layout. The iPad landscape test also covered Spanish, P3's fractional equation, and navigation that retains a checked sketch and draft equation.
- Vercel verification for the callout, P3 sketch, and navigation update is pending publication.
- The two separate related-lines scripts (`scripts/test-related-lines.mjs` and `scripts/test-related-lines-v2.mjs`) fail looking for **Create my results image**. The same failures were reproduced at `c56cf8f`.
- Both Vercel deployments for `ced4605` succeeded. `macintodd-math-site-nhx6` serves the custom domain. Verified the live student sketch in a simulated iPad landscape viewport, including graph centering, tap replacement, drag, equation keypad, and the Spanish toggle. The live teacher route returned HTTP 200.

## Still open

- Test the native MathBoard bridge on a physical iPad connected to a projector or external display. Verify that taps, drag, diagnostic zoom, Slide 1 callouts, P3 sketches, and review navigation appear on the projector and that the receiver stays read-only.
